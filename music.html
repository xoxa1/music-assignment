            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>What would I do without your smart mouth?<br>
            Drawing me in and you kicking me out<br>
            You've got my head spinning, no kidding<br>
            I can't pin you down<br>
            What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?<br>
            I'm on your magical mystery ride<br>
            And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me<br>
            But I'll be alright</p>

            <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
            <p>My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine<br>
            You're crazy and I'm out of my mind</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>'Cause all of me loves all of you<br>
            Love your curves and all your edges<br>
            All your perfect imperfections<br>
            Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you<br>
            You're my end and my beginning<br>
            Even when I lose, I'm winning</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Post-Chorus</h3>

        <section>
            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>How many times do I have to tell you?<br>
            Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too<br>
            The world is beating you down, I'm around<br>
            Through every mood<br>
            You're my downfall, you're my muse<br>
            My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues<br>
            I can't stop singing, it's ringing<br>
            In my head for you</p>
